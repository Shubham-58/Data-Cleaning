Data Cleaning and Data Wrangling Projects in Excel and Bi Tools

DO checkout the JP Morgan Data Analysis Project and its Presentation. Its one of my earliest hands on working with Excel and Charts, including the file named My Learning, it sounds a little lame ik, bear with me and just take a look



This Repository contains all the files that I've worked upon for Cleaning and Validating Data.
Each file has two separate sheets- 1st, cleaned and read to be analyzed data sheet and the next one Unclean Datasheet. They're titled accordingly

Its more of demonstration of use of functions and different clauses in Excel.
From basic Arithmetic Functions(SUM, SUBTRACT, MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, COUNT) to Logical Functions (AND, IF, OR), Text Functions (UPPER, LOWER, PROPER, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, TRIM, CONCAT) and some little complex (barely for me) Statistical ones like (COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, SUMIF, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS, MEDIAN, MODE )  



Take a look and let me know what you feel :)
