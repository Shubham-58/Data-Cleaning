Data Cleaning and Data Wrangling Projects in Excel and Bi Tools

This Repository contains all the files that I've worked upon for Cleaning and Validating Data.
Each file has two separate sheets- 1st, cleaned and read to be analyzed data sheet and the next one Unclean Datasheet. They're titled accordingly

Its more of demonstration of use of functions and different clauses in Excel.
From basic Arithmetic Functions(SUM, SUBTRACT, MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, COUNT) to Logical Functions (AND, IF, OR), Text Functions (UPPER, LOWER, PROPER, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, TRIM, CONCAT) and some little complex (barely for me) Statistical ones like (COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, SUMIF, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS, MEDIAN, MODE )  

Take a look and let me know what you feel :)
